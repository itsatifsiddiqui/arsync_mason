# UX Guidelines

## Navigation Principles

### Primary Navigation
- Bottom navigation for main app sections
- Swipe gestures for related screens
- Back button for hierarchical navigation

### Secondary Navigation
- Tabs for related content categories
- Modals for focused tasks
- Bottom sheets for supplementary actions

## Interaction Patterns

### Buttons & Controls
- Provide immediate visual feedback on tap
- Use ripple effects on Android, subtle highlight on iOS
- Disable buttons when actions aren't available
- Position primary actions within thumb reach

### Forms & Input
- Validate input in real-time where appropriate
- Show inline validation messages
- Auto-advance when possible
- Support autofill for personal information

### Error Handling
- Show specific, actionable error messages
- Position errors close to the problem area
- Provide clear recovery paths
- Use appropriate error states (inline for fields, alerts for system issues)

## Loading & Progress

### Loading States
- Show skeleton screens for content loading
- Use progress indicators for operations
- Communicate progress for multi-step flows
- Keep users informed of background processes

### Empty States
- Provide helpful guidance in empty screens
- Use illustrations to explain purpose
- Include clear calls-to-action
- Maintain brand personality

## Feedback & Confirmation

### Success States
- Confirm important actions clearly
- Use animations sparingly for key moments
- Provide next steps after completion
- Keep success messages brief and positive

### Transitions
- Use natural, smooth transitions between states
- Keep animations under 300ms
- Maintain spatial relationships during transitions
- Ensure transitions add meaning, not just decoration

## Accessibility

### Visual Accessibility
- Support dynamic text sizes
- Maintain minimum touch targets (48x48dp)
- Ensure 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio for text
- Design for color blindness

### Inclusive Design
- Support screen readers
- Enable keyboard navigation
- Provide alternatives for gestures
- Consider motor impairments in interaction design
